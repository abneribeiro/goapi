  title: Equipment Rental API
  description: |
    A comprehensive RESTful API for equipment rental management. This API enables users to rent equipment from owners, manage reservations, and handle the complete rental lifecycle.

    ## Features
    - **User Management**: Register and authenticate users with JWT tokens
    - **Equipment Catalog**: Browse, search, and filter available equipment
    - **Reservation System**: Create and manage equipment reservations with approval workflows
    - **Notification System**: Real-time notifications for reservation updates

    ## Authentication
    This API uses **JWT Bearer tokens** for authentication. After logging in, include the token in the `Authorization` header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
    ```

    ## User Roles
    - **Owner**: Can list equipment for rent, approve/reject reservations
    - **Renter**: Can browse equipment and make reservations

    ## Reservation Workflow
    1. Renter creates a reservation request
    2. Owner approves or rejects (or auto-approve if enabled)
    3. Renter uses the equipment during the reservation period
    4. Owner marks the reservation as completed
